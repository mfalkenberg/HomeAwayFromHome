### Purpose:
We are a group of junior developers currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp offered through UC Berkeley extension. Since all of our creators are from very different cultures, we wanted to design an app that allows every individual to feel close to home even when they’re miles and miles away. We provide detailed information about neighborhoods (including but not limited to: average rent, walk scores, home listings, etc.) Our hope is to give every individual the opportunity to access important information that is necessary to consider when making a new move. We are currently based in the Bay Area (more specifically Berkeley), but we plan to expand across neighborhoods throughout the country. 

### How to use it:
1. Initially click on a neighborhood primarily based on map location and rent prices (based on average rent of 1 bedroom apartments)
2. Be given specific data on that neighborhood from Wikipedia API, Walk Score API, and Google Places API
3. Have the option to directly search for properties through Zillow widget or navigate to the feedback page and give us some criticism.
